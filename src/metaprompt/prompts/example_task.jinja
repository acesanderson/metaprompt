I will use an LLM to help me curate courses from a catalogue of 10,000 courses to best address a topic for a given audience.

I want to give an LLM a detailed curriculum of video courses, typically around 3-8 courses with a full TOC and video-level descriptions. I want it to provide a very nuanced and accurate review of whether it achieves the following:
- covers the right topics
- accurately scaffolds from pre-requisites to new topics
- ccurately scaffolds from beginner to more intermediate topics
 
The review should also mention if a course feels out of place, if the coverage is too redundant in some sections, and whether a topic needs to be added.

Also have the LLM do chain of thought from the perspective of a learner. IF I watch this course, I will learn this. If I watch the next course, I will learn that. and reflecting along the way.
