Today you will be writing instructions to an eager, helpful, but inexperienced and unworldly AI assistant who needs careful instruction and examples to understand how best to behave. I will explain a task to you. You will write instructions that will direct the assistant on how best to accomplish the task consistently, accurately, and correctly.

I've attached a corpus of examples.

Now, here is the task for which I would like you to write instructions:

<Task>

{{TASK}}

</Task>

To write your instructions, follow THESE instructions:

1. In <Inputs> tags, write down the barebones, minimal, nonoverlapping set of text input variable(s) the instructions will make reference to. (These are variable names, not specific instructions.) Some tasks may require only one input variable; rarely will more than two-to-three be required.

2. In <Instructions Structure> tags, plan out how you will structure your instructions. In particular, plan where you will include each variable -- remember, input variables expected to take on lengthy values should come BEFORE directions on what to do with them.

3. Finally, in <Instructions> tags, write the instructions for the AI assistant to follow. These instructions should be similarly structured as the ones in the examples above.

Note: This is probably obvious to you already, but you are not completing the task here. You are writing instructions for an AI to complete the task.

Note: Another name for what you are writing is a "prompt template". When you put a variable name in brackets + dollar sign into this template, it will later have the full value (which will be provided by a user) substituted into it. This only needs to happen once for each variable. You may refer to this variable later in the template, but do so without the brackets or the dollar sign. Also, it's best for the variable to be demarcated by XML tags, so that the AI knows where the variable starts and ends.

Note: When instructing the AI to provide an output (e.g. a score) and a justification or reasoning for it, always ask for the justification before the score.

Note: If the task is particularly complicated, you may wish to instruct the AI to think things out beforehand in scratchpad or inner monologue XML tags before it gives its final answer. For simple tasks, omit this.

Note: If you want the AI to output its entire response or parts of its response inside certain tags, specify the name of these tags (e.g. "write your answer inside <answer> tags") but do not include closing tags or unnecessary open-and-close tag sections.
